## About Me

Hello readers, welcome to my DREU Project blog!  My name is Mike Tota, currently a senior at Gallaudet University majoring in Information Technology.  I will graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology this August.  Growing up, I've always had a natural interest in computers, and often was the person my family depended on when they had technical issues with the devices, software, etc you name it.  With this natural knowledge, I am passionate about continuing and expanding my knowledge and skillsets to contribute to the society, future company/agency, or organization.

## About My Project

Captioning for teleconferencing is essential for the 36 million Americans who are deaf or hard of hearing. Access to teleconference captions has a direct impact on participation in society, especially for those working or studying from home during the covid-19 pandemic era. We are in the middle of a disruptive transition to computer-generated captions that can be viewed anywhere, anytime, including through teleconferencing These new technologies create different types of caption errors, compared with human-generated captioning techniques that have evolved over 40 years. As a result, there has been much consumer frustration. With these new technologies, it is critical to understand how caption errors impact consumers who rely on human and computer generated captions.
